# Facial-Expression-Detection-using-convolutional-neural-network

In this project, I had focused on following objectives:

1.      Develop a facial expression recognition model in Keras

2.      Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN)

3.      Apply the model to real-time video streams and image data

 

The essential attributes of the project is given below:

1.      Essential Modules: Numpy, Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib

2.      Dataset used for training and testing: Emotion FER Dataset [Training Set 28,709 examples, Test Set 3589 examples]

3.      A convolutional neural network with 4 convolution layers and 2 fully connected layers to predict 7 types of facial expressions.

4.      Adam as the optimizer, categorical cross entropy as the loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
